Hi, 
I’ve been diving into our recent product, transaction, and user data, and I wanted to share some key findings and a few open questions that need your input. 
Here’s a quick summary:

Key Data Quality Issues

Missing or Incomplete Data:
- Missing Manufacturer/Brand Info: Many products have placeholder values like “PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER” or “NONE,” which makes it tricky to analyze manufacturer-specific trends.
- Missing Barcodes: Some transactions don’t have barcodes, so we can’t link those purchases to specific products.
- “zero” in FINAL_QUANTITY: The word “zero” appears instead of a numeric value in some transactions. Is this indicating returns, out-of-stock items, or something else?
- Missing Barcodes with FINAL_SALE: Some transactions have a sale value but no barcode, so it’s unclear what product was purchased.

Insight from Analysis
- Millennials contribute the highest percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category, followed closely by Gen Z. What’s really interesting is that users aged 21 and over are much more likely to buy Health & Wellness products than Snacks. 
This makes sense, as we’re seeing a bigger focus on health and self-care these days, especially among younger folks. 
Brands like COLGATE (for Oral Care) and EMERGEN-C (for Vitamins & Supplements) are standing out as some of the top favorites in this space.


Request for Action:
To further refine the analysis and resolve outstanding issues, I would need help with the following:

- Clarify “zero” Quantity Transactions: Are these returns, errors, or something else? My suggestion is to replace them with a numeric value (e.g., 0) for consistency.
- Address Missing BIRTH_DATE: For users without birth dates, can we either get this info or exclude them from age-based analyses?
- Investigate Missing Barcodes: Can we confirm why some barcodes are missing in the transaction data? Is this a system limitation or a data collection issue?
- Standardize Barcode Formats: Can we ensure barcodes are in a consistent format across all datasets to avoid mismatches?
- Replace Placeholder Values: Can we clarify or replace “PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER” and “NONE” with actual manufacturer names?

Once we resolve these issues, I can provide a more detailed analysis, including:

- A breakdown of top-performing brands and categories.
- Insights into purchasing behavior by demographic (age, gender, location).
- Recommendations for targeted marketing or product development.

Would love your thoughts on these next steps. Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
Sini Sam
